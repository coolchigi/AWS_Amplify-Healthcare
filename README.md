### About the App

In 2022, I faced a dilemma while choosing a healthcare provider, specifically an ophthalmologist, for a discomfort I was experiencing. I realized there was a gap in the market for an app that could provide comprehensive information about healthcare providers in a specific city, including their opening hours, services offered, and user reviews. This realization inspired the creation of MediFind. MediFind aims to transform the healthcare industry by offering a comprehensive platform for both healthcare providers and patients. The app boasts a variety of innovative features designed to enhance user experience and streamline healthcare services.
